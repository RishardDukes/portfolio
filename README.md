I am a hardworker, making quirky ideas into working code. I have built numerical methods toolkits, computer vision pipelines, and ML demosâ€”while also getting my hands dirty with practical IT tasks like connectivity checks and troubleshooting. I value clean, well-documented code and clear results.

*Projects you can actually use.*
That has grown into my motto. Iâ€™m a hard-working engineer who delivers clean, well-documented code that solves real problems. Iâ€™ve built numerical-methods toolkits, computer-vision pipelines, and ML demosâ€”and I still get hands-on with practical IT work like connectivity checks and troubleshooting. I value clarity, reliability, and results.

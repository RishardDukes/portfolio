# Numerical Integration & ODE Solvers — Error & Convergence Suite

A mini-library comparing Trapezoidal vs. Simpson’s rules with log–log error plots.

## Run
```bash
# from repo root
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python numerical_methods/numerical_demo.py
```

## Output
- Log–log plot of error vs. N for both methods.

## Notes
- No datasets required.
- Edit `f(x)` and `[0, 1]` to test other functions/intervals.
